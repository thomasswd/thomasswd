Hey there, I'm Thomas and I am an electrical engineer turned into a web developer. I am particularly passionate about Front End UI and love learning new tech in this field. 
The languages and technologies I am currently using are Javascript(ES6+), React, HTML & CSS, SASS, Node.js + Express, and MongoDB. 

I most recently learned how to make a full website using Node.JS and Express along with Pug as a templating engine. The project in the course was to make a site that lets
a user add stores/ restaurants in a yelp-like way and allows for functionality that includes authentication using Passport, the ability to like certain stores, see the 
top rated ones, and the ability to filter stores based on tags. The database was handled using MongoDB and Mongoose. 

I am currently looking for entry level job opportunities so feel free to reach out to me.
